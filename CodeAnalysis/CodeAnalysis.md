# Code Analysis for Software Security Engineering
## TeamASJY

### Code Review Strategy

For the code review of Mailpile, we decided to use both an automated and manual analysis approach. The automated code review was performed using the Bandit and Pylint analysis tools and the entire codebase of Mailpile was scanned. These tools were mainly used to identify potential security concerns and general flaws with the source code that could cause problems with the software. For the manual code review, we decided to follow a risk-based approach in order to identify flaws in the critical security functions of Mailpile. Once any flaws were determined, they were categorized based on the CWE that they describe.
