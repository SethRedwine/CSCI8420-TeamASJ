### Project Motivation

### Mailpile

**Description**

[Mailpile](https://www.mailpile.is/) is an email client built with a focus on security, making it easy for users to send and receive signed or PGP encrypted email. 

The client is built mainly on Python, Javascript, and HTML and offered for macOS, Linux, and Windows. Though, the Linux distribution is the only offering not being reworked at the moment.

The project has three main contributors:

* [Bjarni R. Einarsson](http://bre.klaki.net/)
* [Smári McCarthy](https://smarimccarthy.is)
* [Brennan Novak](https://brennannovak.com)

But the project has received contributions from more than 140 contributors to date. The project has had 26 commits just in the last month and has incorporated over 550 pull requests over the life of the project, so it seems to be fairly active. Contributors can find a lot of good documentation on the project, from [design documents](https://github.com/mailpile/Mailpile/wiki/Design-documents) to a list of [keyboard shortcuts](https://github.com/mailpile/Mailpile/wiki/Keyboard-shortcuts), on the [wiki](https://github.com/mailpile/Mailpile/wiki).

### Licensing and Contributions
---

The Mailpile client is licensed under the GNU Affero General Public License (AGPLv3), which can be read about [here](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.html). This is a copyleft license that requires people to disclose any modifications made to the source code under this license but not any other part of their own code.

To contribute to Mailpile, the process seems fairly straightforward. One can find the Mailpile team’s guidelines [here](https://github.com/mailpile/Mailpile/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md). After checking the [FAQ](https://github.com/mailpile/Mailpile/blob/master/DEV_FAQ.md) and ensuring that the problem is indeed an issue, one can open a new issue documenting the problem, if it hasn’t already been documented. Then, submit a pull request with a description clearly describing both the problem and its solution. All contributions to the project are made under the same AGPLv3 license, but there is a tag of the code that is dual-licensed under both the AGPLv3 and the Apache License 2.0 that can be forked and developed independently.
